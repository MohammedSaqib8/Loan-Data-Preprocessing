# Loan Data Preprocessing using NumPy

This project by 365 Careers provided me with gainful insights about being a data analyst. As a main goal for a data analyst, this project involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, before handing it over to the Data Scientists for Credit Risk Management (CRM), for ascertaining the probability of default through Machine Learning models. The changes made to the raw dataset was also documented.

The data relates to a Central Bank in Europe.
While measuring the credit worthiness of each candidate, it is of utmost importance that we are extremely risk-averse and distrustful. The missing values in the dataset are subject to foul play because loan applications are self reported, since we only lend loans to candidates who are financially stable, in case of missing information we assumed the worst case scenario. Since worst case scenarios are different in every column of the dataset, the missing values were dealt in accordance with the casting instructions provided by the Data Science Team.
